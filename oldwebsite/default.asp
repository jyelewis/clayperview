		<br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Check your Junk Mail or Spam folder in your 
		email client. Some mail settings have their spam/junk mail filters set 
		high and these type of automated emails will get caught up in the Junk 
		Mail by accident instead of making it to your Inbox.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">What browsers and/or devices are supported for 
		Live Video and On-Demand Highlights?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Live streams and video on demand content, can 
		be viewed from any device that can be used to watch either HTML5 or 
		Flash content. Browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Internet 
		Explorer (IE 8 or higher). Mobile: All iOS devices including iPhones and

		<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>What do I do 
		if the video is choppy, not smooth or buffering?</strong></span><br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Since this is the Internet, choppy video can 
		happen from time to time, but it should not stay that way for any long 
		period of time. If it does please try the following.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Make sure you have enough down speed bandwidth 
		with your home/office Internet provider. Minimum requirement is 1.75 
		Mbps (1750 Kbps).<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">If you are unsure of your Internet connection 
		speed, please refer to Item 1 on this page for ways to test your speed.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">If you are sure of what your Internet Speed 
		package is with your provider, Test your speed anyway (see Item 1 on 
		this page) and make sure your connection is still strong and that there 
		is not any outages/interruptions with your local service provider.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">WiFi connections can sometimes cause this as 
		they are not as reliable as a hard line (Ethernet) connection and will 
		experience more fluctuation in speed over a period of time.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Any other users/computers on the same Internet 
		connection can draw speed away from your broadcast. Especially if 
		another user is streaming video, downloading files or music, etc.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Try to Refresh/Reload the page by forcing it 
		to go out to the server to bring the page back in (not cached). Do this 
		by holding the Shift key and clicking the Refresh/Reload button in your 
		browser.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Clear browser cache, close down your browser, 
		re-launch the browser, re-login to The Cushion and try the video again.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Try another browser. Internet Explorer (IE) 
		has always been the browser that is behind and seems to need to most 
		support, not just for live video, EVERYTHING. So we recommend Firefox 
		over IE, but with that said, our video has been tested in ALL browsers 
		including iOS and Andriod devices.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style2"><strong>What computer requirements do I need?</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Smooth video playback requires minimum Intel 
		Pentium 4 or equivalent with latest version of Flash. Minimum 64mb video 
		ram suggested.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">We recommend the latest version of Flash, but 
		the video will stream fine on Flash version 10.5 or higher.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Full screen viewing provides a nice experience 
		but require more computer processing power. Intel Dual Core or 
		equivalent suggested for smooth full screen playback.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Non Intel Macintosh Computers and First 
		generation Netbook computers using Atom processors may have insufficient 
		processing power to view even our Base Player smoothly.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">You can download the latest Flash version 
		here: Adobe Flash Player</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">As with all computing tasks, eliminating 
		unnecessary running apps will free up processing power and provide for a 
		better viewing experience.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<br class="auto-style1" />
		<br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style2"><strong>What do I do if my audio is not 
		working?<br />
		</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">1st basic step, make sure your speakers are 
		turned on and make sure the volume is up.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Test your computer’s audio by playing another 
		audio file, like a music file.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Check/Test your sound by going to Start –&gt; 
		Control Panel –&gt; Sounds and Audio Devices. Under the Volume tab make 
		sure Mute is not checked and that the volume scroll is somewhere in the 
		middle. Test a sound by clicking on the Sounds tab then choosing a sound 
		file like Default Beep and click the play arrow below.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">If you are connecting your computer to a TV, 
		make sure you have the audio cables connected and run properly to the 
		right inputs.<br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">Clear browser cache and then close down your 
		browser completely. Then re-launch the browser, re-login to The Cushion 
		and try the Video page again and see if audio has now kicked in.<br />

		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>What if 
		there is a rain-out for a Live PPV Broadcast?</strong></span><br />
		</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">The PPV live broadcast is handled exactly as 
		if you were at the track. If the track calls it a rain-out before it is 
		an official race, we will offer all that paid a rain check for a free 
		broadcast to the next event of equal value. Rain checks will be granted 
		under the email address used for the original purchase. Now if rains 
		come, but it is considered an official race by the track, then it is an 
		official race with the PPV broadcast as well.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style2"><strong>Rain Out Policy</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />

		cancelled and less than five events being successfully completed 
		Valvoline Raceway will honour rainchecks but will not refund any money.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
